# Demystifying SDKs - Tinker Time with Twilio!

## Pre-Workshop Preparation

Before our workshop on SDKs and the Twilio API, it's important that every
participant is prepared with the required tools. Please follow the steps below
to ensure a smooth experience:

1. Twilio

If you don't already have a Twilio account, visit Twilio's [sign up
page](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) to sign up for a free account.

Note down your Account SID and Auth Token, as these will be essential for the workshop exercises.


2. Replit

If you don't already have a Replit account, visit Replit's [sign up
page](https://replit.com/signup) to sign up for a free account.

Replit provides a cloud based environment where we can all experiment with both
client and server side code without needing to set up a custom environment.
